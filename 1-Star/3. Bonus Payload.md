# Bonus Payload
Use the bonus payload `<iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allow="autoplay" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/771984076&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=true&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true"></iframe>` in the DOM XSS challenge.

### Intro
This is more of a fun little one that demonstrates what you can do with the <iframe> command. I won't do a full breakdown like the others, just fill in some key concepts

### Solution
Just paste the payload into the search bar, same as the last one. It will load up the Juice-Shop jingle in a small player and autoplay. 

The key takeaway here is a little bit about how <iframe> works. <iframe> is allowed to pass in several security configurations because it operates in a sandbox window within the website, thus making it largely harmless to the wider website. Especially because as a DOM payload it only affects the client who put it there. Later on we'll be using </script> payloads which are policed much more heavily. 

Of course there are still ways that an exploit could happen, notably stolen packets via insecure networks and an attacker who submits false, malicious requests. The fact that the website is HTTP allows that vector to exist.

Anyway that's 3 down!
