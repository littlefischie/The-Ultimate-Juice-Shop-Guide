Ready to start stealing? This challenge falls in line with previous ones where we need to recon to find places we're not supposed to see. 

From the previous challenges you've explored the site somewhat and become familiar with some of its mechanisms for navigation. This challenge is more looking through available pages, but with a slight twist to the formula you've learned thus far. Give yourself 15 or so minutes and try using the tools you learned before to try solving this one.

### Solution
`<URL>/ftp` takes us to a page with multiple files. Clicking on `aquisitions.md` will download it and pop the challenge. 

This challenge teaches us to 1. recognize FTP as file transfer protocol, a likely place to go looking for files and 2. realize that not all pages are built with angular, some are static. 

This also sets us up for following challenges. There are also a few other interesting files in that directory, but they'll require a little bit more trying to exfiltrate.
