# Error Handling

### Intro
Doing this one right now is definitely optional. If you haven't already gotten it on accident you certainly will in the future. However, we can absolutely just get it now. Poke around and see what you find!

### First Guidance
Try just messing around with the URLs and endpoints. Plug in URLs that you know won't end anywhere. 

### Second Guidance
Pay attention to the pages that are static, not angular. Add sub-domains and see what happens.

### Solution
There are a million solutions here, but the easy one I used is `<URL>/ftp/anything` It'll take you to an error page that says only .md or .pdf files and when you come back to the score board it will pop the challenge.

Errors can be useful to provoke. Once we start using our tool to properly see and manipulate requests errors will become useful data.
