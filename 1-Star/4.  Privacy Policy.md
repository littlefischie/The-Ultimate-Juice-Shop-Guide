# Privay Policy
Read our privacy policy.

### Intro
This challenge is also fairly simple, but teaches how to navigate the website. All you have to do is poke around until you can find the privacy policy. Of note: there are at least two ways of accomplishing this one. Take 15 minutes to poke around and see what you can find!

### First Guidance
Try making an account. It opens up more navigation options.

### Solution
Make an account, click on account -> Privacy & Security -> Privacy Policy
or
Goto `<URL>/#/privacy-security/privacy-policy`
or
The devs also mention that a crawler or scraper tool could also pop the challenge.

So this challenge is a bit of chuckle on the part of the devs again, joking that no one ever actually reads the privacy policy. Still, it's not bad practice for recon. Looking across as many pages of the website or digging through the paths in `main.js` and putting together sub-domains sets us up for challenges down the road. For now, 4 down!
