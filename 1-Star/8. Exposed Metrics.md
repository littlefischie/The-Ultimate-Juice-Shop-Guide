# Exposed Metrics
Find the endpoint that serves usage data to be scraped by a `[popular monitoring system](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus)`.

### Intro
This is an interesting challenge that teaches you something that you will use constantly going forward. Google. The description gives you a link to the tool its refering to: Prometheus. There's a lot of information out there about Prometheus so start looking!

### First Guidance
If you open up developer tools and goto the network tab, you'll see that every request goes to `/something/somethingelse`. These are the end-points, or where your request ends up and what responds to it. So remember that the solution is in that style.

### Second Guidance
Juice-Shop uses the default Prometheus endpoint. See if you can find any information about that via Google.

### Solution
`<URL>/metrics` 

This page holds a lot of data about Juice-Shop as to how it runs, the calls, storage size, etc. We won't really be using it going forward, so for now understanding everything isn't all that important. Of course, if this piques your interest go ahead and learn as much as you'd like. 

The key takeaway here is just doing research on various tools you may want or need to use in the future. When you come across a service you need to exploit in the future this tool research is vital.
